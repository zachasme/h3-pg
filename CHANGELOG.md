# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Critical bugfixes or breaking changes are marked using a warning symbol: ⚠️

_The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)._

## Versioning

The H3 core library adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
H3-pg has a `major.minor.patch` version scheme. The major and minor version
numbers of H3-pg are the major and minor version of the bound core library,
respectively. The patch version is incremented independently of the core
library.

Because H3-pg is versioned in lockstep with the H3 core library, please
avoid adding features or APIs which do not map onto the
[H3 core API](https://uber.github.io/h3/#/documentation/api-reference/).

- ⚠️ Update `h3` core library to `v4.0.0`. Almost all functions have been renamed to align with `h3` core `v4`. Please take care when updating. You can see a [list of changed function names](https://h3geo.org/docs/library/migration-3.x/functions) in the core library documentation.
