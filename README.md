# PostgreSQL bindings for H3

This library provides PostgreSQL bindings for the [H3 Core Library](https://github.com/uber/h3). For API reference, please see the [H3 Documentation](https://uber.github.io/h3).

Developed in collaboration with [Scandinavian Highlands](http://www.scandinavian-highlands.com).

## Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL 9.6 or higher (_including server headers_). It might work with earlier versions, we have not tested earlier than 9.6.
- C compiler (e.g., gcc)
- GNU Make
- Git & CMake (for libh3)

## Quick Overview

If the prerequisites are met you can use the PGXN Client to download, build, and install, e.g.:

```shell
$ pgxn install h3
$ pgxn load h3
$ psql
=# SELECT h3_lat_lng_to_cell(POINT('37.3615593,-122.0553238'), 5);
  h3_lat_lng_to_cell
-----------------
 85e35e73fffffff
(1 row)
```

#### On macOS with the Postgres.app Universal Binary

```shell
brew install pgxnclient make cmake
export CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64;x86_64"
pgxn install h3
```

## Usage

> :tada: **Note:** The following usage docs apply to **H3 v4**, which was released on August 23, 2022.
>
> - For v3 docs, [see the latest v3.x.x release](https://github.com/bytesandbrains/h3-pg/blob/v3.7.2/README.md).
> - For breaking changes in v4, [see the CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md). In particular, most [function names have changed](https://h3geo.org/docs/library/migration-3.x/functions).

Generally, all functions have been renamed from camelCase in H3 to snake*case in SQL with an added `h3*` prefix.

See [API reference](docs/api.md) for all provided functions.
